# ECE 410 Repository #
This repository serves as the main documentation hub for all challenges and assignments for ECE410 for Spring 2025. Weekly work can be found in the associated directory, along with a README.md that serves as a blog post for that week's challenges. Additionally, a separate project directory will track work done for the Final Project, regardless of what week that work occured. 

## Weekly Challenges ##
```Week_01``` was our introduction to using LLMs as coding collaborators.

```Week_02``` explores perceptrons and their limitations.

```Week_03``` describes work done to optimize the Q-algorithm for hardware.

```Week_04``` focuses on using CUDA to parallelize computation.

```Week_05``` primarily focuses on using systolic architecture for sorting algorithms.

```Week_06``` relates to hardware design through a HDL LIF neuron and a SPICE crossbar.

```Extra``` contains work done for a self-imposed challenge related to memcapacitors.

```Week_08``` and ```Week_10``` are currently works in progress. While ```Week_07``` and ```Week_09``` were skipped in favor of more hands-on challenges throughout the other weeks; the papers and podcast were consumed without producing a written summary/response.

## Project ##
The ```Project``` directory documents the weekly codefest and additional verification work related to the final project in this course. The goal was to accerelate a machine learning workload for eventual deployment as a chiplet. Our chosen algorithm, ParallelWaveGAN, presented many challenges and the work remains in progress due to the major obstacle of complicated control timing and trouble with verifying the FSM.
